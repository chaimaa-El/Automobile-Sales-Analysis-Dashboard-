# Automobile Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Project Description

This project aims to analyze historical trends in automobile sales, with a focus on the impact of recession periods. It involves creating visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium for data exploration, followed by developing a dashboard using Plotly and Dash for interactive data analysis.

### Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization

This part involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on historical automobile sales data. Various visualization techniques are used to understand patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.

### Part 2: Dash Dashboard Development

In this part, a dashboard is developed using Dash, allowing users to interactively explore automobile sales data and gain insights into recession periods' impact on sales trends.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Dash)
- Jupyter Notebook
- HTML/CSS

## About the Dataset

The dataset includes variables such as Date, Recession indicator, Automobile Sales, GDP, Unemployment Rate, Consumer Confidence, Seasonality Weight, Price, Advertising Expenditure, Vehicle Type, Competition, Month, and Year. By analyzing these factors, insights into recession impacts on automobile sales are gained.
