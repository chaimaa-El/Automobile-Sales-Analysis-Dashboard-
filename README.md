# Automobile Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Project Description

This project aims to analyze historical trends in automobile sales, with a focus on the impact of recession periods. It involves creating visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium for data exploration, followed by developing a dashboard using Plotly and Dash for interactive data analysis.

### Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
In this part, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the historical automobile sales dataset. Various visualization techniques such as line charts, scatter plots, bar charts, and pie charts were employed to analyze automobile sales, advertising expenditure, GDP, unemployment rates, and other relevant factors.

#### Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook


### Part 2: Dash Dashboard Development

In this part, I developed a dashboard using Dash, a Python framework for building web applications. The dashboard allows users to interactively explore the automobile sales data and gain insights into the impact of recession periods on sales trends. Dropdown menus are provided to select different types of reports (e.g., yearly statistics, recession period statistics), and the dashboard dynamically updates the visualizations based on user selections.

#### Technologies Used

- Python (Plotly, Dash)
- HTML/CSS (for customizing the dashboard layout and styling)

## About the Dataset

The dataset includes variables such as Date, Recession indicator, Automobile Sales, GDP, Unemployment Rate, Consumer Confidence, Seasonality Weight, Price, Advertising Expenditure, Vehicle Type, Competition, Month, and Year. By analyzing these factors, insights into recession impacts on automobile sales are gained.
